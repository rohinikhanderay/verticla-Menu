                <p>

                    Inc. , its officers, directors, employees, agents, and third
                    parties, for any losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses
                    (including reasonable attorney’s fees) relating to or
                    arising out of your use of or inability to use the Site or
                    services, any user postings made by you, your violation of

                <h3>Arbitration</h3>
                <p>
                    In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute
                    between them arising out of or concerning these Terms and
                    Conditions, or any provision hereof, whether in contract,
                    tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any
                    other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by
                    final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal
                    Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator
                    and administered by the American Arbitration Associate, or a
                    similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a
                    location mutually agreed upon by the parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND NULEEP, INC. WILL BE
                    RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND YOU ARE
                    WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A
                    PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR
                    REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The arbitration will be administered by the American
                    Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the
                    Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary
                    Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”)
                    then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute
                    Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at
                    https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at
                    1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the
                    interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
                </p>
                <h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>
                <p>
                    Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take
                    place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and
                    class/representative/collective actions are not permitted.
                    THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
                    OTHER ONLY IN EACH’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
                    PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUNITATIVE CLASS,
                    COLLECTIVE AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE
                    FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further, unless both you and Nuleep, Inc. agree otherwise,
                    the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s
                    claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
                    representative or class proceeding.
